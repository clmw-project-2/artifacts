Team Manager is a web application that allows users to manage a team, join a team, or evaluate a player’s “skills.” There are three types of users: coach, player, and recruiter. A coach has the option to create a single team and manage that team; they can extend offers to join the team to new players and assign workouts to current team players. Additionally, the coach may see the value of a player’s skill (out of 100) when deciding to extend offers. This is provided by a recruiter, who assigns a value to a player’s skill field. Players who log in are navigated to a home screen where they are able to view offers from teams to accept/reject, edit their profile and listed skills, and view workouts they have assigned to them.
